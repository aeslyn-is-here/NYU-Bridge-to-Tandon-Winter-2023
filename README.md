# NYU-Bridge-to-Tandon-Winter-2023
The NYU Tandon Bridge course was developed to build foundational skills in those without a technical background in order to prepare for applying to our select STEM graduate programs. Taught by faculty of the NYU Tandon Computer Science department, this 100% online course covers topics that include discrete math, data structures and algorithms, and principles of operating systems. 
This repository contains some of my homework assignments from my time in Bridge. I received a Certificate of Distinction, indicating I completed the program with at least a B+.
